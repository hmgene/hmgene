- 👋 I am a bioinformatician studying the evolution of information based on biological data.
- 👀 I passionately delve into the realm of biological computation, which is about computation, regulation, expression of biomolecules in a cell. 
- 🌱 I believe bio=information. Therefore, it is programmed in DNA code, and run via internal/external invluences.
- 💞️ keywords: core-regulatory circuitry (CRC), gene regulatory network(GRN), alternative splicing (AS), polyadenylation (APA), single-cell lung repairment
- 📫 For inquiries, you can contact me at human.gim@gmail.com.
